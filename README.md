This project has been developed entirely for the purpose of learning Node.js and enhancing my programming skills. It serves as a practical application to deepen my understanding of server-side development. Additionally, this project has been created to help me retain the Front-end knowledge I have acquired, ensuring that I do not forget the essential concepts and techniques that I have learned in that area.

By working on this project, I aim to integrate my Front-end expertise with new back-end skills, allowing for a more comprehensive grasp of full-stack development. This journey not only strengthens my technical abilities but also boosts my confidence in building more complex applications in the future.
